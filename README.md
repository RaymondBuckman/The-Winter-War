The top of the page consists of a full screen video, centered text, a menu icon at the top right that toggles the navbar, & a moving down arrow that takes the user to the next section of the page.

This screenshot shows the active navbar. Within the navbar, the section that user is viewing has inverted colors relative to the rest of the navbar sections. Snow particle effects take place within the background, & when reaching around the halfway point of the screen, the image will become pinned for the length of the paragraph. Hovering over the image reveals additional details. Hovering over links bolds the text(as shown above).

The headers for all sections changes langauges as the user scrolls up. Toward the bottom of the screen, the text will be in Russian or Finnish, then after a certain point...
